  title: GRADITUDE - Leave Your Mark
  description: "Donate to Graditude today and support the student experience in your department: http://graditude.skule.ca/
               The tradition of Graditude began back in 1983, when a group of students took it upon themselves to address a deficiency in student club funding. In addition to holding a referendum where students voted to pay an additional $100 per year above regular tuition to help alleviate the shortfall in their equipment budget, they began Graditude as a way for graduating students to make a class pledge to give back to Skule™. The idea caught on and the rest of the University followed suit.
               Today, Graditude is a way for you to leave your mark at Skule™. It is a gift to the future generations of Skule™ students who will benefit from your contributions. From the moment you stepped on campus, you have benefited from those who came before you. It's your chance to follow in the steps of Skule™ alumni.
               Giving to Skule™ shows your class pride – and means a great deal to future classes. U of T Engineers educate future leaders, like you, who will help to shape the world. Think of giving back to Skule™ as an investment to better the society."
